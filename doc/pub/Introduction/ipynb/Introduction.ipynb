    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "During the last two decades there has been a swift and amazing\n",
    "development of Machine Learning techniques and algorithms that impact\n",
    "many areas in not only Science and Technology but also the Humanities,\n",
    "Social Sciences, Medicine, Law, indeed, almost all possible\n",
    "disciplines. The applications are incredibly many, from self-driving\n",
    "cars to solving high-dimensional differential equations or complicated\n",
    "quantum mechanical many-body problems. Machine Learning is perceived\n",
    "by many as one of the main disruptive techniques nowadays. \n",
    "\n",
    "Statistics, Data science and Machine Learning form important\n",
    "fields of research in modern science.  They describe how to learn and\n",
    "make predictions from data, as well as allowing us to extract\n",
    "important correlations about physical process and the underlying laws\n",
    "of motion in large data sets. The latter, big data sets, appear\n",
    "frequently in essentially all disciplines, from the traditional\n",
    "Science, Technology, Mathematics and Engineering fields to Life\n",
    "Science, Law, education research, the Humanities and the Social\n",
    "Sciences.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview of these introductory notes\n",
    "\n",
    "The aim of these notes is to give you a birds view over overarching issues on  Machine Learning, a brief review of programming with Python and libraries we will use in this course, a reminder on statistics and finally our first encounters of Machine Learning methods applied to an evergreen in Nuclear Physics, fitting nuclear binding energies.\n",
    "If you are familiar with basic Python programming and statistics, you can easily jump some of the introductory material here.\n",
    "\n",
    "After these introductory words, the set of lectures will contain the following themes:\n",
    "* Linear Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "* Logistic Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "* Decision Trees, Random Forests, Bagging and Boosting\n",
    "\n",
    "* Neural Networks and Deep Learning methods\n",
    "\n",
    "* Convolutional and Recurrent Neural Networks and how to analyze experimental results\n",
    "\n",
    "* Generative Models\n",
    "\n",
    "* Reinforcement Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "* The experimental data we will analyze are based on experiments from $\\beta$-decay experiments and data from Active Target experiments\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Machine Learning, short overview\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Machine Learning, a small (and probably biased) introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Ideally, machine learning represents the science of giving computers\n",
    "the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.  The idea is\n",
    "that there exist generic algorithms which can be used to find patterns\n",
    "in a broad class of data sets without having to write code\n",
    "specifically for each problem. The algorithm will build its own logic\n",
    "based on the data.  You should however always keep in mind that\n",
    "machines and algorithms are to a large extent developed by humans. The\n",
    "insights and knowledge we have about a specific system, play a central\n",
    "role when we develop a specific machine learning algorithm. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Machine Learning, an extremely rich field\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning is an extremely rich field, in spite of its young\n",
    "age. The increases we have seen during the last  decades in\n",
    "computational capabilities have been followed by developments of\n",
    "methods and techniques for analyzing and handling large date sets,\n",
    "relying heavily on statistics, computer science and mathematics.  The\n",
    "field is rather new and developing rapidly. Popular software libraries\n",
    "written in Python for machine learning like\n",
    "[Scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/),\n",
    "[Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/),\n",
    "[PyTorch](http://pytorch.org/) and [Keras](https://keras.io/), all\n",
    "freely available at their respective GitHub sites, encompass\n",
    "communities of developers in the thousands or more. And the number of\n",
    "code developers and contributors keeps increasing.\n",
    "\n",
    "## A multidisciplinary approach\n",
    "\n",
    "Not all the\n",
    "algorithms and methods can be given a rigorous mathematical\n",
    "justification (for example decision trees and random forests), opening up thereby large rooms for experimenting and\n",
    "trial and error and thereby exciting new developments.  However, a\n",
    "solid command of linear algebra, multivariate theory, probability\n",
    "theory, statistical data analysis, understanding errors and Monte\n",
    "Carlo methods are central elements in a proper understanding of many\n",
    "of the algorithms and methods we will discuss.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<!-- !split  -->\n",
    "## Learning outcomes\n",
    "\n",
    "These sets of lectures aim at giving you an overview of central aspects of\n",
    "statistical data analysis as well as some of the central algorithms\n",
    "used in machine learning.  We will introduce a variety of central\n",
    "algorithms and methods essential for studies of data analysis and\n",
    "machine learning. \n",
    "\n",
    "Hands-on projects and experimenting with data and algorithms play a central role in\n",
    "these lectures, and our hope is, through the various examples discussed in this series of lectures,\n",
    "to  expose you to fundamental\n",
    "research problems in these fields, with the aim to reproduce state of\n",
    "the art scientific results. \n",
    "More specifically, you will\n",

    "1. <font color=\"red\">Learn about basic data analysis, data optimization and machine learning</font>;\n",
    "\n",
    "2. <font color=\"red\">Be capable of extending the acquired knowledge to other systems and cases</font>;\n",
    "\n",
    "3. <font color=\"red\">Have an understanding of central algorithms used in data analysis and machine learning</font>;\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Types of Machine Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The approaches to machine learning are many, but are often split into\n",
    "two main categories.  In *supervised learning* we know the answer to a\n",
    "problem, and let the computer deduce the logic behind it. On the other\n",
    "hand, *unsupervised learning* is a method for finding patterns and\n",
    "relationship in data sets without any prior knowledge of the system.\n",
    "Some authours also operate with a third category, namely\n",
    "*reinforcement learning*. This is a paradigm of learning inspired by\n",
    "behavioral psychology, where learning is achieved by trial-and-error,\n",
    "solely from rewards and punishment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way to categorize machine learning tasks is to consider the\n",
    "desired output of a system.  Some of the most common tasks are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Classification: Outputs are divided into two or more classes. The goal is to   produce a model that assigns inputs into one of these classes. An example is to identify  digits based on pictures of hand-written ones. Classification is often supervised learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Regression: Finding a functional relationship between an input data set and a reference data set.   The goal is to construct a function that maps input data to continuous output values.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Clustering: Data are divided into groups with certain common traits, without knowing the different groups beforehand.  It is thus a form of unsupervised learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Essential elements of ML\n",
    "\n",
    "The methods we cover have three main topics in common, irrespective of\n",
    "whether we deal with supervised or unsupervised learning.\n",
    "* The first ingredient is normally our data set (which can be subdivided into training, validation  and test data). Many find the most difficult part of using Machine Learning to be the set up of your data in a meaningful way. \n",
    "\n",
    "* The second item is a model which is normally a function of some parameters.  The model reflects our knowledge of the system (or lack thereof). As an example, if we know that our data show a behavior similar to what would be predicted by a polynomial, fitting our data to a polynomial of some degree would then determin our model. \n",
    "\n",
    "* The last ingredient is a so-called **cost/loss** function (or error function) which allows us to present an estimate on how good our model is in reproducing the data it is supposed to train.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## An optimization/minimization problem\n",
    "\n",
    "At the heart of basically all Machine Learning algorithms we will encounter so-called minimization or optimization algorithms. A large family of such methods are so-called **gradient methods**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## A Frequentist approach to data analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "When you hear phrases like **predictions and estimations** and\n",
    "**correlations and causations**, what do you think of?  May be you think\n",
    "of the difference between classifying new data points and generating\n",
    "new data points.\n",
    "Or perhaps you consider that correlations represent some kind of symmetric statements like\n",
    "if $A$ is correlated with $B$, then $B$ is correlated with\n",
    "$A$. Causation on the other hand is directional, that is if $A$ causes $B$, $B$ does not\n",
    "necessarily cause $A$.\n",
    "\n",
    "These concepts are in some sense the difference between machine\n",
    "learning and statistics. In machine learning and prediction based\n",
    "tasks, we are often interested in developing algorithms that are\n",
    "capable of learning patterns from given data in an automated fashion,\n",
    "and then using these learned patterns to make predictions or\n",
    "assessments of newly given data. In many cases, our primary concern\n",
    "is the quality of the predictions or assessments, and we are less\n",
    "concerned about the underlying patterns that were learned in order\n",
    "to make these predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In machine learning we normally use [a so-called frequentist approach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequentist_inference),\n",
    "where the aim is to make predictions and find correlations. We focus\n",
    "less on for example extracting a probability distribution function (PDF). The PDF can be\n",
    "used in turn to make estimations and find causations such as given $A$\n",
    "what is the likelihood of finding $B$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is a good model?\n",
    "\n",
    "In science and engineering we often end up in situations where we want to infer (or learn) a\n",
    "quantitative model $M$ for a given set of sample points $\\boldsymbol{X} \\in [x_1, x_2,\\dots x_N]$.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we will see repeatedely in these lectures, we could try to fit these data points to a model given by a\n",
    "straight line, or if we wish to be more sophisticated to a more complex\n",
    "function.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason for inferring such a model is that it\n",
    "serves many useful purposes. On the one hand, the model can reveal information\n",
    "encoded in the data or underlying mechanisms from which the data were generated. For instance, we could discover important\n",
    "corelations that relate interesting physics interpretations.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, it can simplify the representation of the given data set and help\n",
    "us in making predictions about  future data samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "A first important consideration to keep in mind is that inferring the *correct* model\n",
    "for a given data set is an elusive, if not impossible, task. The fundamental difficulty\n",
    "is that if we are not specific about what we mean by a *correct* model, there\n",
    "could easily be many different models that fit the given data set *equally well*.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is a good model? Can we define it?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The central question is this: what leads us to say that a model is correct or\n",
    "optimal for a given data set? To make the model inference problem well posed, i.e.,\n",
    "to guarantee that there is a unique optimal model for the given data, we need to\n",
    "impose additional assumptions or restrictions on the class of models considered. To\n",
    "this end, we should not be looking for just any model that can describe the data.\n",
    "Instead, we should look for a **model** $M$ that is the best among a restricted class\n",
    "of models. In addition, to make the model inference problem computationally\n",
    "tractable, we need to specify how restricted the class of models needs to be. A\n",
    "common strategy is to start \n",
    "with the simplest possible class of models that is just necessary to describe the data\n",
    "or solve the problem at hand. More precisely, the model class should be rich enough\n",
    "to contain at least one model that can fit the data to a desired accuracy and yet be\n",
    "restricted enough that it is relatively simple to find the best model for the given data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, the most popular strategy is to start from the\n",
    "simplest class of models and increase the complexity of the models only when the\n",
    "simpler models become inadequate. For instance, if we work with a regression problem to fit a set of sample points, one\n",
    "may first try the simplest class of models, namely linear models, followed obviously by more complex models.\n",
    "\n",
    "How to evaluate which model fits best the data is something we will come back to over and over again in these set of lectures.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Practicalities, choice of programming language and other computational issues\n",
    "\n",
    "## Choice of Programming Language\n",
    "\n",
    "Python plays nowadays a central role in the development of machine\n",
    "learning techniques and tools for data analysis. In particular, seen\n",
    "the wealth of machine learning and data analysis libraries written in\n",
    "Python, easy to use libraries with immediate visualization(and not the\n",
    "least impressive galleries of existing examples), the popularity of the\n",
    "Jupyter notebook framework with the possibility to run **R** codes or\n",
    "compiled programs written in C++, and much more made our choice of\n",
    "programming language for this series of lectures easy. However,\n",
    "since the focus here is not only on using existing Python libraries such\n",
    "as **Scikit-Learn**, **Tensorflow** and **Pytorch**, but also on developing your own\n",
    "algorithms and codes, we will as far as possible present many of these\n",
    "algorithms either as a Python codes or C++ or Fortran (or other languages) codes. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Software and needed installations\n",
    "\n",
    "We will make extensive use of Python as programming language and its\n",
    "myriad of available libraries.  You will find\n",
    "Jupyter notebooks invaluable in your work.  You can run **R**\n",
    "codes in the Jupyter/IPython notebooks, with the immediate benefit of\n",
    "visualizing your data. You can also use compiled languages like C++,\n",
    "Rust, Julia, Fortran etc if you prefer. The focus in these lectures will be\n",
    "on Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have Python installed (we strongly recommend Python3) and you feel\n",
    "pretty familiar with installing different packages, we recommend that\n",
    "you install the following Python packages via **pip** as (examples of relevant packages)\n",

    "install **brew**. Brew allows for a seamless installation of additional\n",
    "software via for example \n",

When an assembly of nucleons of the same size is packed together into the smallest volume, each interior nucleon has a certain number of other nucleons in contact with it. This contribution is proportional to the volume.\n",
    "\n",
    " * There is a surface energy term $a_2A^{2/3}$. The assumption here is that a nucleon at the surface of a nucleus interacts with fewer other nucleons than one in the interior of the nucleus and hence its binding energy is less. This surface energy term takes that into account and is therefore negative and is proportional to the surface area.\n",
    "\n",
    " * There is a Coulomb energy term $a_3\\frac{Z^2}{A^{1/3}}$. The electric repulsion between each pair of protons in a nucleus yields less binding. \n",
    "\n",
    " * There is an asymmetry term $a_4\\frac{(N-Z)^2}{A}$. This term is associated with the Pauli exclusion principle and reflects the fact that the proton-neutron interaction is more attractive on the average than the neutron-neutron and proton-proton interactions.\n",
    "\n",
