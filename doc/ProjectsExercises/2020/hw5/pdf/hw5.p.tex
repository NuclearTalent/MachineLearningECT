\subsection{Regression examples, from linear regression, via decision trees and various forests to neural networks}

The main aim of this project is to study some specific 
regression problems, starting with the regression algorithms studied
in homework set 3 (exercise 2 in particular).
We will include decision trees, random forests and eventually boosting
methods  and neural network with \textbf{tensorflow} (feel free however to write your own code). 

The case we encounter here
is  the so-called Ising model for  our training data and we will
focus on supervised training. We will follow closely the recent
article of \href{{https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.08823}}{Mehta et al, arXiv
1803.08823}. This article stands
out as an excellent review on machine learning (ML) algorithms.
The added benefit is that each figure and
model presented in \href{{https://physics.bu.edu/~pankajm/MLnotebooks.html}}{this article is accompanied by its jupyter
notebook}. This
means that we can start using these and compare with our own results.

You can also look up the \href{{https://compphysics.github.io/MachineLearningECT/doc/pub/Day1/html/Day1.html}}{Regression slides for a discussion of the Ising model} (scroll down to the end).

Alternatively, you can replace the Ising thorughout the exercises with the nuclear binding energies. The choice is yours. Or if you have other data sets suitable for regression, feel free to use those.


What follows here is however a discussion of the Ising model. The nuclear binding energies were discussed during the lectures.

With the abovementioned configurations we will determine, using first
various regression methods, the value of the coupling constant for the
energy of the one-dimensional Ising model.
We will mainly use \textbf{scikit-learn} or \textbf{tensorflow} or other Python packages such as \textbf{keras} or other.

Feel free to use the notebooks to benchmark your code.  


\paragraph{Part a): Producing the data for the one-dimensional Ising model.}
The model we will employ in our studies is the so-called \href{{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ising_model}}{Ising
model}.  Together with
models like the \href{{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potts_model}}{Potts
model} and similar
so-called lattice models, the Ising model has been widely studied in
mathematics (in statistics in particular), physics, \href{{https://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.93.062402}}{life
science},
chemistry and even in the \href{{https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9781461420316}}{social sciences in order to model social
behavior}. It is a
simple binary value system where the variables of the model (spins often in
physics) can take two values only, for example $\pm 1$ or $0$ and $1$.
The system exhibits a phase transition in two or higher dimensions and
the first person to find the analytical expressions for various
expectation values was the Norwegian chemist \href{{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lars_Onsager}}{Lars
Onsager} (Nobel prize in
chemistry) after a tour de force mathematics exercise.

In our discussions here we will stay with a physicist's approach and
call the variables for spin. You could replace this with any other
type of binary variables, ranging from a two political parties to blue
and red spheres.  In its simplest form we define the energy of the
system as

\begin{equation*}
  E=-J\sum_{<kl>}^{N}s_ks_l,
\end{equation*}
with  $s_k=\pm 1$, $N$ is the total number of spins,
$J$ is a coupling constant expressing the strength of the interaction
between neighboring spins.

The symbol $<kl>$ indicates that we sum over nearest
neighbors only.
Notice that for $J>0$ it is energetically favorable for neighboring spins
to be aligned. This feature leads to, at low enough temperatures,
a cooperative phenomenon called spontaneous magnetization. That is,
through interactions between nearest neighbors, a given magnetic
moment can influence the alignment of spins  that are separated
from the given spin by a macroscopic distance. These long range correlations
between spins are associated with a long-range order in which
the lattice has a net magnetization in the absence of a magnetic field.



We start by considering the one-dimensional Ising model with nearest neighbor interactions. This model does not exhibit any phase transition.

Consider the 1D Ising model with nearest-neighbor interactions 

\begin{equation*}
  E[\hat{s}]=-J\sum_{j=1}^{N}s_{j}s_{j+1},
\end{equation*}

on a chain of length $N$ with so-called periodic boundary conditions and $S_j=\pm 1$ Ising spin variables.
In one dimension, this model has no phase transition at finite temperature.

In the Python code below we generate, with a coupling coefficient set to $J=1$, a large number of spin configurations say $10000$ as shown in the code below.
It means that our data will be a set of $i=1\ldots n$ points of the form
$\{(E[\boldsymbol{s}^i],\boldsymbol{s}^i)\}$.
Our task is to find the value of $J$ from the data set using linear regression.

Here is the Python code you need to generate the training data, see
also the \href{{https://physics.bu.edu/~pankajm/ML-Notebooks/HTML/NB_CVI-linreg_ising.html}}{notebook of Mehta et
al}.

\bpycod
import numpy as np
import scipy.sparse as sp
np.random.seed(12)

import warnings
#Comment this to turn on warnings
warnings.filterwarnings('ignore')

### define Ising model aprams
# system size
L=40

# create 10000 random Ising states
states=np.random.choice([-1, 1], size=(10000,L))

def ising_energies(states,L):
    """
    This function calculates the energies of the states in the nn Ising Hamiltonian
    """
    J=np.zeros((L,L),)
    for i in range(L):
        J[i,(i+1)%L]-=1.0
    # compute energies
    E = np.einsum('...i,ij,...j->...',states,J,states)

    return E
# calculate Ising energies
energies=ising_energies(states,L)
\epycod

We can now recast the problem as a linear regression model using our codes from homework set 3 (exercise 2 in particular).
The way we are going to build our model mimicks the way we could think of finding say the gravitional constant for the graviational force between two planets.
In the absence of any prior knowledge, one sensible choice is the all-to-all Ising model

\[
E_\mathrm{model}[\boldsymbol{s}^i] = - \sum_{j=1}^N \sum_{k=1}^N J_{j,k}s_{j}^is_{k}^i.
\]

Here $i$ represents a particular spin configuration (one of the possible $n$ configurations we generated with the code above).

This model is uniquely defined by the non-local coupling strengths $J_{jk}$ which we want to learn.
The model is linear in $\mathbf{J}$ which makes it possible to use linear regression.

To apply linear regression, we recast this model in the form
\[
E_\mathrm{model}^i \equiv \mathbf{X}^i \cdot \mathbf{J},
\]

where the vectors $\mathbf{X}^i$ represent all two-body interactions
$\{s_{j}^is_{k}^i \}_{j,k=1}^N$, and the index $i$ runs over the
samples in the data set.  To make the analogy complete, we can also
represent the dot product by a single index $p = \{j,k\}$,
i.e.~$\mathbf{X}^i \cdot \mathbf{J}=X^i_pJ_p$.  Note that the
regression model does not include the minus sign, so we expect to
learn negative $J$'s.

\paragraph{Part b): Estimating the coupling constant of the one-dimensional Ising model using linear regression.}
We start with the one-dimensional Ising model and use the data we have
generated with $J=1$ in the previous point.

\textbf{Use linear regression,
Lasso and Ridge regression as done in homework 3}.
Make an analysis of the guessed coupling constant as function of the hyperparameters $\lambda$. 
You can compare your
results with those of \href{{https://physics.bu.edu/~pankajm/ML-Notebooks/HTML/NB_CVI-linreg_ising.html}}{Mehta
et al.}.
Make sure it is the 1D data which is used.

Discuss the methods and how they perform in computing the coupling
constant $J$ and include a bias-variance analysis using the bootstrap resampling method.
Discuss also the mean squared error and
the $R2$ score as measures to assess your model.

Give a critical analysis of your results.


You can replace the Ising model data with the nuclear binding energy data.



\paragraph{Part c): Random forests and boosting.}
Repeat the above analysis but using random forests and boosting (XGboost or normal gradient boosting). You can use the functions
in \textbf{scikit-learn} for random forests and gradient boosting. For \textbf{XGBoost} you need to install it separately. You can still use other functionality in \textbf{scikit-Learn}. 

\paragraph{Part d): Regression analysis of the one-dimensional Ising model using neural networks.}
Your aim now is to use either \textbf{scikit-learn} or \textbf{tensorflow} in order to set up a neural network to find the optimal weights and biases. 

Train your network and compare the results with those from your linear regression code and random forests/boosting methods. 

You can test your results against a similar code using \textbf{scikit-learn} or \textbf{tensorflow/keras}. 


A useful reference on the back progagation algorithm is \href{{http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/}}{Nielsen's book}. It is an excellent read.


Finally, give a critical analysis of your results with pros and cons of the various methods.
